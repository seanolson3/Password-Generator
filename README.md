# Password-Generator
Password Generator (random module/while loop/function)

Future Additions:

**[COMPLETE]** 1. Encapsulate the code in a function: Wrap the code in a function to make it reusable and modular. This allows you to easily call the function whenever you need a password with specific requirements.

2. Add parameter validation: Validate the input provided by the user. Check if the password length is within a reasonable range and prompt the user again if an invalid input is provided.

3. Implement a password strength check: Besides meeting the minimum requirements of having at least one special character and two digits, you can also add a password strength check. This can involve checking the length of the password, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, and the absence of common patterns or easily guessable information.

4. Provide feedback on password strength: Consider providing feedback to the user on the strength of the generated password. You can use a password strength meter algorithm or a library to evaluate the password and give it a rating (e.g., weak, medium, strong).

5. Use a cryptographically secure random number generator: Instead of using secrets.choice(), which uses the random module internally, consider directly using the secrets module for generating random values. The secrets module provides a more secure way of generating random numbers suitable for cryptography purposes.

6. Allow customizing the character sets: Instead of hard-coding the character sets for letters, digits, and special characters, you can provide an option for the user to specify their own character sets or choose from predefined sets.

7. Add command-line interface (CLI) support: Convert the code into a command-line script that can be executed with arguments, allowing users to specify the desired password length and other parameters directly from the command line.

8. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI): Develop a graphical user interface that allows users to input their desired password requirements and generates a password accordingly. This can be done using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt.

9. Store the generated password securely in a database: If the generated password needs to be stored, consider using a password manager or encryption techniques to protect it.
